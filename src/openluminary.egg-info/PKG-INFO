## Vision
OpenLuminary is an open-source, AI-powered financial analysis and portfolio management system built on the powerful Qwen3-235B model. Our mission is to democratize advanced financial technology, providing capabilities that surpass proprietary systems like BlackRock's Aladdin while remaining accessible to all.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Real-time financial data processing and analysis
- Advanced risk assessment and management
- AI-driven portfolio optimization
- Market prediction and trend analysis
- Comprehensive reporting and visualization
- Multi-asset class support

## Technical Architecture
OpenLuminary leverages the Qwen3-235B-A22B model fine-tuned on financial datasets to provide sophisticated financial analysis capabilities:

- **Core Engine**: Fine-tuned Qwen3 model specialized for financial reasoning
- **Data Integration Layer**: Connectors to major financial data sources
- **Analysis Modules**: Risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and market prediction
- **API Layer**: RESTful and GraphQL interfaces for integration
